****  See we have mainly 3 files: 'index.html', 'server.js', 'client.js'

1. As this is a express project, so we need to put all static files like styles.css, client.js and images in public folder
2. Message (div) will be dynamically created by javascript in client.js, so we omit that hard coded message div from index.html
3. First of all we ask user his/her name using prompt (in index.html)






**** The work flow is preety simple:

1. User write the message, press enter or click on send button to send the message, which we can get by 'textArea.value'.
2. We create a class 'msg' with 2 property, name and message. We append that dynamic HTML using javascript (in client.js)

3. CLIENT SIDE ---> SERVER SITE
    a> We then send msg to server (using socket.emit()) 
    b> Server will recieve that messagesend from client side (using socket.on())

4. SERVER SIDE ---> OTHER USER's CLIENT SIDE
    a> Server then broadcast that msg to all other users who are connected to this socket/server (except self) (using socket.broadcast.emit())
    b> Client (other users) then recieve that msg (using socket.on()), and then append that dynamic HTML using javascript (in client.js)





Thats it .....
